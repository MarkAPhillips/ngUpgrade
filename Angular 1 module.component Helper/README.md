# Angular 1 module.component() Helper

This Angular 1 helper will make it easier to create "component" directives in Angular 1. The API should map reasonably well to the Angular 2 concept of a component.

See the discussions:

* https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/10007

* https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/12166

## API Considerations

* What are the key use cases that we want to support?

* What are sensible defaults so that on the whole not many options need to be specified?


## Implementation Considerations

Is this change purely syntactic sugar or do we need to make real changes to the compiler to support this?
