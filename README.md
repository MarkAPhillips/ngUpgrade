# ngUpgrade

A repository describing strategies and ideas to aid upgrading from Angular 1 to Angular 2

Much of the information in this repository has been take from the ["AngularJS 1 to Angular 2 Upgrade Strategy"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xvBZoFuNq9hsgRhPPZOJC-Z48AHEbIBPlOCBTSD8m0Y) design doc.

## Background

Angular 1 and Angular 2 have different syntax and semantics.
